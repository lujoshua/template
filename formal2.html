			<p style="float:left">Supply chain management is the study of how resources and goods come together to reach the customer, and ultimately the consumer. There are three distinct yet interconnected areas that are considered apart of supply chain management, procurement, operations management, and, logistics. In the U.S. News & World Report ranks Michigan State University is ranked as the number one supply chain management program in the United States. One of the many reasons I chose to study this major is because of this fact. Michigan State has an excellent program and it seems like a secure way for a career.  Although this major may not be what I am passionate about, it is the best program in the nation, and it is safe for me to go down this pathway. There is still time for me to change my mind, however. Of the different focuses of supply chain management, procurement is the one I am most interested in.</p>
