			<p>Supply Chain management is a fairly new term. It is the process of acquiring materials, and combining them into production to selling it to the customers. It is a complicated process that requires the use of effective communication with all sorts of people and using technology to analyze certain situations. I found that researching this topic for me was very difficult. I felt like I might be disinterested in supply chain management. This report helped me realize to reconsider what I am studying as I struggle to write this paper. At first, I thought supply chain would be a terrific program for me, but I canâ€™t seem to find the passion for it yet. I now see the importance of finding something you love to do as a career, otherwise it will be a difficult life.
