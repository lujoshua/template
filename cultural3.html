			<h1>Analysis of Artifact</h1>
			<img style="height:260px;float:left"src="http://images5.fanpop.com/image/photos/28300000/-Hannah-Montana-best-of-both-girls-28306978-1280-1024.jpg"/>
			<p>Miley Cyrus’ career breakthrough was from her lead in a Disney Channel children’s TV show, Hannah Montana. The first episode of Hannah Montana had the most viewers for a Disney Channel show (TV Guide). This popularity, led to the popularity and fame of Cyrus, and Disney insisted on commercializing her.  She became the first artist for Disney to have multiple deals in TV, consumer products, music, and movies(McNamara). Hannah Montana has 140 items of merchandise, “including clothes, watches, bedding, luggage, shoes, makeup, spa kits, and toys” (Tirella).This lifted to her to more fame and wealth. </p>
		<p>Hannah Montana led Cyrus into her musical career as Cyrus would perform as Hannah Montana.  Disney released the first Hannah Montana soundtrack with eight songs credited to Montana, and one song credited to Cyrus and her father Billy Ray Cyrus.  After her second season casting as Montana, Cyrus signed a four year album deal. Cyrus got the number one position on The Billboard 200 with the album, “Hannah Montana 2 (Soundtrack)/Meet Miley Cyrus). Disney sold 326,000 albums. Cyrus also starred in many successful movies including Bolt, and Hannah Montana: The Movie.</p>
		<p>As Cyrus transitioned into a more of an adult image, she tried shedding away from Hannah Montana past. She had some success with her endeavors. Her hit song “Party in the USA” shifted her image from a Disney Channel character to a pop star. The song peaked at peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 (Ben-Yehuda). She starred in the film The Last Song, and it received poor reviews, and her acting was heavily scrutinized (Rotten Tomatoes). As mentioned earlier, she also starred in LOL, which was about a teenager who experimented with sex and drugs. It only earned $46,500 on its opening weekend (Rosen). Cyrus was beginning to fade from the spotlight. She began to musical covers of classic songs and uploaded them to Youtube. There is no specific evidence of how she slowly became distanced from the celebrity scene, but she did not have the same amount of attention during her Hannah Montana years or during her current career post MTV’s VMA performance.</p>
		<p>Cyrus wanted to change people’s views on whom and what she was. She went to the extreme to shed any sort of connection to Hannah Montana. Cyrus’ controversial performance where she shook her buttocks against Robin Thicke’s groin drew a lot of attention. She set records for the number of tweets per minute during her performance at 306,100. Her show surpassed the tweets per minute even at the most recent Super Bowl (Popkin). Following the VMAs, she released a controversial music video, “Wrecking Ball”. She is seen naked, riding a wrecking ball, and licking a sledge hammer. She was criticized for her behavior. The Parents Television Council said that “MTV marketed adults-only material to children while falsely manipulating the content rating to make parents think the content was safe for their children”(Reed). The irony is that her father serves on the council’s advisory board. Many singers including, Justin Timberlake, Lady Gaga, and her own father, Billy Ray Cyrus defended her behavior. </p>
		<p>It was necessary for Cyrus to perform these lewd acts in order to attract the attention that she so desired. Our culture dictated it to be so. As a teenage pop star, Cyrus was not gaining any popularity from her Hannah Montana days. Our society expects women to become much sexualized and it is having a very negative effect on women and girls.</p>
