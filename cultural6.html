			<h1>Anticipated Effects</h1>
			<p>The anticipated results of some of these ideas may achieve limited success. Awareness is important, but it must lead to policy change. The issue with certain policy changes like restricting or even censoring these images is that it is unconstitutional. The media is powerful and can hold a lot of influence over Congress with their lobbying to keep things the way they are (Elliot). They will fight for their right of freedom of expression. Unless our society rejects the sexualization of women, the media will portray women as is because it would make the media the most money. Community based movements to combat the sexualization of women is possible, implementing a program to educate girls and young women of the effects of the issue and to encourage them about their self worth not being tied to their physical attractiveness.</p>
