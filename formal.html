			<p>This assignment will be used to research and gain more knowledge about supply chain management and to report how it is connected with technology as well as communications. Supply chain management is the flow of goods from one place to another. From raw materials to processing and to the stores, to the point of consumption this process is the essence of supply chain management. Supply chain management is one of the majors that are part of the business program at Michigan State. According to the paper “A New Introduction to Supply Chains and Supply Chain Management: Definitions and Theories Perspective” by Janiver- James, supply chain management encapsulates a few areas of study, logistics, procurement, and operations management. It is all about the process. Logistics is optimizing managing how resources flow from start to finish, the end product. It is important Operations management is managing the process of production. Research in supply chain is necessary to streamline the process, making it more efficient, finding new technologies to aid the efficiencies. To increase the velocity of supply chain it is necessary to understand the customers’ demands. Businesses use the methods to acquire materials, and create a plan where they can produce the good, and eventually sell it to their customers. Technology is very important as it is used in supply chain by optimizing warehouse networks and logistics. Communications is vital especially in terms of procurement where the manager has to contact and negotiate prices with suppliers, in order to produce goods.  Research in this discipline is necessary to improve upon the current methods of supply chain 
management.  Research can be applied to all areas of supply chain, new goods to buy as a part of procurement, research in increasing productivity of logistics through new technologies, and improving on how operations management can become more efficient. The purpose of supply chain is to match demand with supply in terms of economics (Cohen and Kunreuther).
