			<h1>Executive Summary</h1>
			<p>Our society has increasingly being more and more sexualized, especially towards women. This is very demeaning to women as they are seen as sexualized objects. It is also harmful to young girls who look up to women and try to imitate their actions. It is wrong because these sexualized ideals affect the mental capacity. The sexualization and objectification undermines the “confidence in and comfort with one’s own body, leading to a host of negative emotional consequences, such as shame, anxiety, and even self-disgust” (American Psychological Association). An example of how women have been sexualized is the celebrity, Miley Cyrus.</p>
		<p>Miley Cyrus is a pop culture icon which America and the world saw her blossom from a young pre-teen to her now mature adult as she is now. She achieved stardom when she began acting for the Disney Channel’s Hannah Montana. Through that fame she signed deals in, TV, music, merchandise, and films. As she transitioned from a child star to a teenage personality, she moved away from her image of a child. She wanted to pursue more mature roles and had limited success.  She starred in the film LOL, where she was a teenager who experimented with drugs, drinking, and sexual activity. The movie flopped, and was only released to 105 theatres in the U.S. (Rosen). </p>
		<p>Cyrus continued to try to image to appeal to a larger audience. She reached her goal by performing at the MTV Video Music Awards. Cyrus “twerked”(shook her hips rapidly so that the buttocks move) against Robin Thicke’s crotch. This controversial performance drew the attention that she wanted, and many people tweeted about her. She made headlines across the nation about her actions. After the initial shock of the show, many other celebrities defended her.</p>
		<p>It is necessary to cover Miley Cyrus’ entire career to fully understand why she had to become so sexualized in our society. She was seen as a child star, but as she aged, she became forgotten. It was not until she did something completely radical, grinding half naked against another singer on national television. Only then was she able to earn back her attention. It has worked, she is on more morning talk shows, she hosted Saturday Night Live, and her newest album has become more popular. Why is that? Why does Cyrus have to strip down and dry hump a man on live television to earn the respect that she desires. Our culture has dictated it to be so.</p>
		<p>It is not wrong what Cyrus does on stage or in her movies, but the influence that she has through the media on the people watching has an adverse effect especially around women. The sexualization of women impacts their attitudes by placing emphasis on this ideal physical beauty that women must have.</p>
		<p>In order to attempt to change the culture’s views on women action must be taken. People must be more aware of the consequences of sexualizing women. Government needs to take action to influence the media, and also implement educational programs to empower women and girls about their own self image. These solutions to the problem may have some success. The government influencing the media may prove to be difficult as the media is a mighty entity, and will fight against any sort of censorship. Raising awareness will probably have the most success and that could lead to the media changing.</p>
