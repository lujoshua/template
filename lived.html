		<h1>Zambia, Vaccinations, and the General Practitioner</h1>
    <img style="height:250px; float:right;" src="http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fc/Flag_of_Zambia_(1964-1996).svg/744px-Flag_of_Zambia_(1964-1996).svg.png"/>	
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px"> My hands were clammy and I began to sweat as the nurse wiped down my arm. 
		I squeezed my eyes shut as she inserted the needle into my arm. I let out a soft grunt as if I was trying to mask my weakness. 
		I was taking a plethora of vaccines and drugs as I prepared for my mission trip to Zambia, Africa. 
		My church youth group and I went to various areas in Zambia, including schools, orphanages, as well as the streets
		donating clothes, and toys, and ultimately spreading the love of Jesus.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px"> Our group rode a bus towards our destinations that we were volunteering at; I saw billboards cautioning all that could read it about the dangers and the risks of AIDS. There were many variations of these ads, warning that a spouse may have cheated on you and to get tested. Others just gave direct warnings about AIDS.  It was sickening and sad to see how AIDS plagued the population of Zambia that led to these billboards being put up. </p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px"> We drove out of the capital, Lusaka, and into wilderness towards rural villages. It was an hour and a half drive through the countryside of Zambia, on unpaved and very rocky roads. This is the Africa that I imagined it to be. Animals roamed, freely; there was a savannah like grassland as far as the eye could see. In the village, our church group went door to door talking with families and taking in their lifestyle. The reality of living out in the wilderness hit us, as we began to understand their situation. There were awful living conditions, where people lived out of huts, and tried to raise animals for resources. It was a simple life for those that lived in the villages. Later, when we got back to America we heard that one of the children in the villages had tuberculosis, and that we need to get tested immediately to see if we caught this deadly disease.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px"> The day that had the greatest impact on me was when we went to feed homeless boys and youth, and just hang out and converse with these guys. I remember listening to a guy my age talk about the scars on his arms. His father was a “bad bad man”, that scalded him with boiling water, and he was forced to run away. We took a pause from the conversation. The food was here. The eyes of the boys followed the food feverishly. We had to calm them down as the pushed and reached for the food. They eventually settled down and they each got their share of food. Watching them eat was… disheartening. They wolfed down their measly meal, licking their plates clean. It was awful to see a human being in starvation and in need of one of life’s basic necessities.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px">	As the boys finished their one and only meal of the day, our youth pastor, Jack, began to give out the excess t-shirts we bought along with the trip. This was a mad scramble towards Jack. These guys were shouting, and exclaiming with glee. They immediately took of whatever item of clothing on their back, to replace it with a clean and new t-shirt. They were so happy! Except for one boy. </p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px">	We ran out of t-shirts. The boy with leather like arms from our conversation earlier was empty handed. He pleaded with our pastor for another shirt. Our pastor just apologized and said he couldn’t do anything. Then what happened next, I will never forget. The boy went from desperate to furious once he realized that he was not getting a shirt. His jaw was clenched as did his fists. And there was this anger that was etched into his face. His eyes dared anyone or anything to even take a glance at him, and his gaze would pierce right back. He was tense. All his muscles were flexed. The look on his face was one that could kill. That is not a hyperbole. To this day I can picture the look of his face disdain, disappointment, and most of all anger. I could feel infuriated as saw the emotions expressed on his face.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px"> <img style="height:300px; float:right;" src="https://scontent-b.xx.fbcdn.net/hphotos-ash3/580974_469240449767625_92095484_n.jpg"/>		The room cleared as those who got their t-shirts quickly left the musky and dirty classroom. The boy stayed. I will admit that I was a little scared to approach him. My friend, Ben, talked with him. He kept telling Ben that he needed a shirt, and Ben realized that he could trade shirts with him. The guy was elated; he got a clean shirt at last. What I did not consider was desperate need for shirts among these homeless boys. In the past years, Pastor Jack has given children clean clothes, only to come back a year later to see the same kids with the same clothes on. A whole year has gone by and this boy has one set of clothes to wear.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px">	As I reflect over this trip I realized that the shots I had taken before the trip foreshadowed what I was going see and experience. I knew going into this trip, that Zambia was in term a third world nation, but did I even know what that meant? I romanticized this nation. I pictured a Lion King-esque atmosphere. Although I did see bits and pieces of this stereotypical Africa, there was a lot more to Zambia then that. The shots showed the dangers of the prevalent diseases in Zambia, and how underdeveloped it was. The vaccinations that I received led me to think to saw a career path that I could consider the medical field. I saw all the technology of the medicine and shots I had to take to prevent sickness from just going into Zambia. I realized that I wanted to do something to help people. I want to work as a general practitioner, a doctor.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px">	As a general practitioner, I will be at the bare minimum to be a medical doctor. I do not want specialize because it would take a lot more years in school, and all that time at school would take away time from my goal of helping others. In an ideal world, as soon as I am able I want to be somewhere in Africa, maybe even Zambia, working or running a health clinic. I want to help treat and prevent AIDS. I want to help eradicate diseases that are no longer relevant in first world nations. And it starts as a general practitioner with direct contact and treatment with the people. I am hoping to be a part of Doctors Without Borders. If I am unable to find funding to be able to support myself, I will plan on working domestically until I am able to sustain myself in a third world country. Although my second plan is not ideal, it is the most realistic to spend more time in America, saving up income, maybe build a name for myself as I strive for a goal of helping the less fortunate.</p>
		<p style="font-family:Arial; font-size:15px">As of now, I am considering becoming a general practitioner to help a underserved population, but I am still open for change. I have a heart for people, especially those that are in need. Being a medical doctor would help with fighting off diseases. I could very well go into working for a non-profit organization. I am not going to be defined by what career or degree that I receive, but rather by the passion I have for other people.</p>
