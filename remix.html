		<h2>COMPOSING IN CONTEXT</h2>
			<p>The issue of excessive cell phone usage had a large impact on creating this project especially knowing how relevant the issue is to the times. We found it relatable and made composing the project very straightforward. We knew there would be plenty of media on cell phone usage so we decided to incorporate some into the documentary. Also with this controversial topic, there was plenty of research and statistics to that was done about this issue, so we knew that we had to back up some of our claims with statistics rather than creating only an emotional response with the documentary. </p>
			<p>Composing at excessive cell phone use and the effects made me more aware of the hypocrisy I had with my own cell phone usage. Often times, I will pull out my phone whilst eating with people and friends. I sort of understood the problem with it, but I ignored it. It was through creating this documentary did I realize how much I used my cell phone in inappropriate situations. To me, if there was ever a break in conversation, a silence, or if I am not included in the conversation, I will take out my phone and go through my social media.  What I did not realize is that I am closing myself from any other person to person communication by looking down at my phone and not listening to conversations where I could jump in to. Sometimes now I even prefer to eat alone so I am to myself and my phone. Creating this project gave me a better understanding of how people can be so unaware of using their phones at the wrong times.</p>
			<p>Composing the documentary seemed a little bit overwhelming at first. Since, I have had little video editing experience it was such an out of the world assignment to me. We organized the project by using the proposal as a base structure to follow. We deviated away from it but there were some key elements of the proposal in the final project. A problem we had was making sure we had enough time in our documentary without using redundant information. Originally, in the proposal we planned on having two interviews with students, but it felt like it would be too much of the same thing, so we had to cut out one of the interviews. One of our group mates came up with the idea of putting in bits of media advertisements that related to our issue into the documentary. Although we were weary of straight taking videos from another source, we agreed that it would be helpful in our documentary, and we also edited out their audio to play a song over the video we used.</p>
			<p>The audience played a role of becoming more area of the problems that can be caused with the use of too much cell phone. Hopefully the video will convict the audience to put down their phones and more person to person interactions. The audience should realize when would be an appropriate time to use a cell phone.</p>
		<h2>PROCESS</h2>
			<p>Our group decided that we wanted to do an issue based off of one of our cultural analysis pieces. At first, I was open to doing my lived experience essay because I love to talk about Zambia, but the cultural analysis was a better fit for the parameters of the project. I did not really want to do the equalization of women because it would be a difficult topic to portray in a documentary.  So it was between cell phones or fast food. We decided against fast food because the cultural artifact used in that piece was a documentary, and we did not want to make it appear like we just mimicked the professional documentary. Cell phones were an easy choice because it was so relatable to our own lives.</p>
			<p>The most challenging part of this project was working with international students. Both of my teammates did a fantastic job, but there were some issues in shooting the group scene. I was not trying to limit showing their diversity with the ways they acted and what they said, but rather trying to focus the scene so that the different cultures would not stand out to the audience. We wanted the audience to focus on cell phones as the issue not cultural differences. I also did a lot of editing especially in the proposal to make sure things sounded correct in American English.
			</p>
			<h2>RESEARCH</h2>
			<p>The research source that was most beneficial was from the Youtube videos that provided the most statistics that were used in our video. The least beneficial was using the cultural analysis essay for facts, the essay did have key information but we decided to not use it in our documentary.	</p>
			<h2>COLLABORATION</h2>
			<p>Most of the time our group worked well, however, we did have our own issues. Before going into this project, we were friends, so we found it easy and open to discuss our own topics. A few problems we had in our group in creating this project was figuring out days that we could meet. Originally we set up a day, but then one of our group mates really wanted to change the date so she could study for exams. Unfortunately the rest of our group was unable to meet on the other suggested days, so our teammate decided to make a sacrifice and meet on the original date. Another issue we had was the content of our group scene in the documentary.  We wanted the scene to seem as natural as possible, but some of the conversations in the scenes seemed too unrealistic and forced. We eventually came up with a very loose script to follow to make sure we could send the right idea across. In the end, everybody made their own compromises for the good of the project. Working in a group was beneficial because we were able to divide up the work so the project was more manageable.</p>
			<H2>PROJECT MANAGEMENT</H2>
			
			<p>As mentioned earlier we used the proposal as a base and then altered the project as we saw fit. If I were to do it again, I would want to involve myself more into the video editing process. One of the group members decided to do all the editing, and then asked us for our thoughts. I also would have scheduled more group meetings to make sure everybody had an input in the video. Communication should have been more important, I created an interview, but the video editor decided it wasn’t needed. I had no idea until the video was finished.

</p>
			<h2>DOCUMENTARY DESIGN</H2>
			<p>The most effective part of the documentary’s design is the transition between the group scene to the statistics. The group scene was meant for the audience to pause and think about the situation and how it connects to his/her own life. Then the statistics will come in to reinforce the message that the documentary is trying to send to the audience. Most of the design decisions was made by our video editor, the rest of the group had our own input after it was made, and changes were made accordingly.
