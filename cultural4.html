			<h1>Description of Issue</h1>
		
			<p>There is not anything inherently wrong with Cyrus’ antics, it’s the way she affects those who look up to her is wrong. The media’s encouragement of women’s sexualization is harmful to women. It can cause issues, emotionally, mentally, their sexuality, and their overall mindset and beliefs.</p>
			<p>The sexualization of women ruins the confidence of one’s own body and it leads to anxiety and shame.  A study (Fredrickson et al., 1998) was conducted where college students alone in a dressing room was to choose between wearing a swimsuit or a sweater. They took a math test in whatever choice of clothing they were wearing. There was no differences in scores between the men, but the women in swimsuits performed significantly worse than the ones in sweaters. The anxiety of a woman’s appearance has a very negative effect on their mental health. Research shows the most common mental health issues in women are eating disorders, low self esteem, and depression (American Psychological Association). Research tells that the exposure to sexualized female ideals is linked with these mental issues.</p>
			<p>This frequent exposure to the media portraying women sexualized affects how women view sexuality and femininity. Young women and girls who consume the mainstream media are more prone to the influence of the sexual stereotypes, showing women as sexual objects (Ward 2002).</p>
