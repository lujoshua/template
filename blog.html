		<h1>Uncle Ronnie Video</h1>
		<p> The purpose of this video is to comment and persuade others 
		 about the negative effects of suicide and to persuade that it is okay to be homosexual. The author uses pathos do achieve his purpose.
		 he talks about his life experiences and how suicide has affected him. He also uses his life stories about homosexuality to send his message. He is very passionate about his beliefs. He structures his message with something that most people can agree on, the wrongness of suicide. But his main purpose was to convince others that it is okay to be gay.
		 This video's structure can help me revise my essay because I realize that I need to connect with my audience in order to make my point.</p>
