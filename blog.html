		<h1>8/29/13 First Day of Class</h1>
			<p> It is the first day of writing class, and I am still trying to find my way around campus, I take out my little foldable map to make sure I am headed towards Bessey. I have never taking a hybrid course before and I am a little nervous of what it entails.  Dr. Daniels introduces the course to us as a writing class as I would expect, but also a class where we had to learn and code our own website. Wait, what? Code? Like computer coding? Like programming that I never understood in high school? What the heck? This is a writing course not a technology one! Oh wait its WRA 110 Science and Technology.  But really, I have no idea how to code, let alone create a website! Our class would learn HTML through Codecademy.com. So there it is the hybrid portion of the class. I suppose it would be important to learn how to code, especially in this day and age.</p>
		<h1>9/5/13 Introduction to Class Resources</h1>
			<p>Well it’s the second week of class I knew I had to do my draft on the lived experiences. It’s only a draft right? I’ll just put some words on this paper and have it ready for submission. Today the professor showed us how to use Github, Elireview, and Codecademy. Github seems so confusing! The schedule of the class seemed to go by quickly introduce paper topic one week, edit it the next and then turn it in the next week. That is only three class periods to do each essay. But actually it is three weeks. I know keeping up with Codecademy, and reading the assignments is going to be difficult because Dr. Daniels will not keep me are my other classmates responsible. I have a feeling that I will do the majority of Cadecademy at the end of the semester.</p>
		<h1>9/12/13 Uncle Ronnie Video</h1>
			<p>The video had a couple of purposes. The video wanted to send a message of it is acceptable and okay to be homosexual, and that there will be plenty of opposition when people come out. The video wants to provide support for struggling homosexuals. Secondly, the video warns against suicide and all the negative effects that it brings. The video achieves its purpose with using various rhetorical devices, using parallelism to describe suicide in a very effective way, “Suddenly you are speaking to everyone at once. Suddenly you are screaming to everyone at once. Suddenly everyone is crying …”. The creator also uses repetition of the words pain and loss and sorrow, he emphasizes each word with the use of and. He appeals to pathos eliciting an emotional response with his heavy words.  The video is structured with using words on screen to give background about his Uncle Ronnie and his situation. Next is the main character’s oratorical response to Uncle Ronnie. Lastly he provides hope to those who are struggling with their sexuality and how to deal with opposition. This video can help with my lived experiences project by challenging me to use more rhetorical devices to make my argument clear and personal. The video encourages me to connect with the audience just like the video did.</p>
		<h1>9/19/13 Lived Experiences Project</h1>
			<p>The lived experiences paper was an excellent project. It led me to consider what my passion in life was for, and that was to help others. I found it a little difficult to connect my career path with a specific technology. I enjoyed writing a personal narrative, it is very easy to talk about myself, there is no research needed. Also, I love to talk or write about Zambia; in fact I cherish it so much that I also wrote about it in a different class. Aw I really want to go back. This essay got me to really think about what I really wanted to do here at Michigan State, it made me realize that I was not just here for the fun or even for the education for that matter, it was so that I can pursue my career.</p>
		<h1>9/26/13 Codecademy</h1>
			<p>Class is cancelled today because of Professor Daniel’s illness. I guess it is time to work on Codecademy. I have not exactly been keeping up with the schedule, but I try to get a few lessons done every week or so. It is kind of fun working through Codecademy. It is like a game with certain achievements and awards you can get by completing a lesson, and the points! There is just a special feeling you get after struggling to figure out the right code, and then finally submitting the code and getting that green button that says next lesson. It is very satisfying when you the green button lights up. Now I am stuck on one of the lessons, the one about lists. I seem to be doing everything correctly but I cannot find my error. I spent at least 15 minutes on it. Doing Codecademy can feel very rewarding, and yet very frustrating at times.</p>
		<h1>10/3/13 Book Report?</h1>
			<p>In my Business 101 course we were tasked to read a book and write a book report on a book in the Popular Business Collection from the Gast Business library. My teacher recommended The Launch Pad: Inside the Y Combinator by Randall Stross. It was a book about an incubator for startups specifically software based.  As soon as my teacher recommended the book I thought of my WRA class. It was very interesting to see how two of my courses collided and connected through coding. The book went through a few different companies’ startup experience through the Y Combinator incubator, and all that was entails of it. Codecademy was even mentioned as one of the startups for Y Combinator and was used as an example of a successful startup. This book helped me relate to how I could connect coding with business, which I am studying. It even almost made me consider doing my own startup with all the success stories that Stross wrote about. This blog entry wasn’t really about WRA, but I felt like I needed to write about it as it related closely with my studies in this course.</p>
		<h1>10/10/13 The Social Network</h1>
			<p>The Social Network has many strong implications about the necessity of formal education as it relates to personal and economic success. Traditional thinking states that formal education has a positive correlation with economic and personal success; however as seen in the movie, the founders of the Facebook drop out of college and forgoing their education, but still achieve success.  I would say having a college degree is critical in sustaining the standard of life in America. It is almost impossible to live off of wages that do not require a college degree. Although the founders of the Facebook did drop out of college, they still managed to gain admission to one of the top universities in the world. This shows that they did value education, and if they did not hit the success that they have now, they would have gone back to school to finish their degrees. They are outliers of this correlation of education and success. </p>
