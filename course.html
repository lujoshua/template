		<h2>Course Retrospective Project</h1>
			<p>	WRA is Michigan State University’s writing requirement, all students need to take and pass the course to graduate. It is meant to be a first year writing course because many other courses expect students to have the writing requirement or an equivalent before taking that course. Specifically, WRA 110 Science and Technology is a course focused on the topics it is mentioned in. This course puts a different spin on any other writing class as one would expect a writing class to be. It is hybrid class, half online and half in classroom. There is heavy emphasis on science and technology. For example students in this course must code and create their own website and put the majority of the papers and assignments on this site. Also a lot of the assignments were to be linked to technology. This course teaches students many skills how to research, write, read, to code, and how to effectively code.  Knowing how to research and cite articles is critical for this course. It is used in all the projects except for the first one. Having background knowledge about coding is very beneficial for prospective students. This course, and maybe the other WRA classes help students better understand themselves and what degrees they want to accomplish. It really forces students to reflect on what they are passionate for and what they stand for. This paper’s aim is to inform incoming students of what WRA 110 is and advice to these students about this course.</p>
			<p>The first paper that was written was the lived experiences project. This project was a personal narrative with the prompt of an experience that one has and how a piece of technology influenced their career path. It is necessary to understand that it is a personal narrative, not an essay describing your major. Although it is important to inform the audience of the specifics of the major, it is more about your life story. Our instructor made it clear that it was an issue in our class that it lacked a narrative feel to the papers. The lived experiences paper was an excellent project. It led me to consider what my passion in life was for, and that was to help others. I found it a little difficult to connect my career path with a specific technology. I enjoyed writing a personal narrative, it is very easy to talk about myself, there is no research needed. Also, I love to talk or write about Zambia; in fact I cherish it so much that I also wrote about it in a different class. This essay got me to really think about what I really wanted to do here at Michigan State, it made me realize that I was not just here for the fun or even for the education for that matter, it was so that I can pursue my career.</p>
			<p>The second paper was a cultural analysis paper. We had to analyze a cultural artifact, and write how it depicts a social issue. This essay was a lot more structured than the previous essay. There were a bunch of sections including an executive summary, background analysis, describing the issue, proposing a solution, anticipating results, and a conclusion. This essay was not too difficult because arguing about a social issue that you’re passionate about makes writing easier. The paper had to be written in MLA or APA format it was necessary to know or to learn how to write in the format. Also research had to be done about the issue to show why it is an issue. The topic I chose was the sexualization of women. It was the only topic that really stood out to me to use. Once I had my idea I sort of just stuck with it, and although it became difficult and I wanted to change topics, it seemed impossible to. My artifact was Miley Cyrus and her recent transformation. Miley Cyrus’ antics just recently occurred and it got me thinking of how she became a sex icon. It was not that difficult of a topic to research because well she was a celebrity, although finding exact data on why the sexualization of women was wrong, and finding the negative effects of it proved to be a challenge. It was a good experience writing about a social issue and arguing for justice of it. </p>
			<p>Thirdly, there is a formal research paper this was by far the most difficult. The writer had to research a major or discipline, and to write about it. This essay did not have a specific structure to follow so it was difficult to fill up the word count. Plus it is necessary to interview a professor in the field and another person in the discipline for your paper. This proved especially difficult because finding people to interview required a lot of effort. This is a paper that cannot be finished overnight and requires many days of planning. The formal research project is the most difficult one we’ve had so far. Researching my intended major was a lot more difficult than I thought it would be. Supply chain management is a fairly new topic and there is not as much in depth research as much as other more popular majors like engineering. The library activity assignment was very beneficial in explaining how to navigate the available research resources that Michigan State has to offer. My background knowledge of the major is very limited. The interview portion was the most difficult. However this project was very beneficial for me to understand what exactly is supply chain management.  Doing this essay made me consider why I wanted to study supply chain management, and how much interest I had in it. </p>
			<p>The multimodal project seemed daunting at first because we were tasked to create a documentary that was 7-9 minutes in length. It was supposed to be about one of our previous three projects. It was a group project so the work could be distributed to each team member. I came up with the scene where there is a group of friends all on their phones except for the main character who tries to communicate with them. The video editing feels like an impossible task. Luckily one of my teammates decided to take it upon herself to do most of the editing. We came together with our ideas, and decided to choose cell phone usage. This project was very eye opening to my cell phone tendencies. It has led me to try to use my phone less. It has made me aware of not only myself but the people I’m with and how cell phones are used. Working in a group was little difficult as expected. We originally agreed on a meeting day, but one of our teammates wanted to cancel due to needing to study for exams. She eventually came to our meeting where we had most of our video shot. It is these little things that make working in a group difficult. Learning how to handle different personalities, and different ethnic backgrounds for me was challenging. Although my teammates and I were friends going into this project, it was difficult as they were international students. I learned from this project that it was not just about the production of the technology, but about working together as a team to achieve our goals in the project.</p>
			<p>This class was a very interesting one, we analyzed various movies and documentaries in class, and we had to write blogs about our essays and in class activities. It is very important to keep up with all the assignments. For me it was difficult to because the class only met once a week and then I would often forget about the readings or the coding lessons that I had to do on Codecademy. The most difficult part of this course was writing the papers.  My downfall was saving the projects till the very last minute and tried to churn out these lengthy essays by pulling all nighters.  Knowing how to budget time is very important especially with this writing course. We also used various Internet resources in. As mentioned earlier, Codecademy was used to learn code. GitHub was the program we used to host our websites. Eli review, was a file sharing site where students can revise their fellow students’ works and give feedback. Desire 2 Learn was vital in the course as we submitted all of our assignments through this site and had group discussions through it too. Many of these resources were difficult to use so it was critical to ask the instructor for help. This course was a very rewarding one which made students really think about who they were and what they wanted to study. I am glad I took this class in the beginning of my collegiate career so I can better understand my passions, better understand my career path, and ultimately better understand myself.</p>
