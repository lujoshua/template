			<p>Procurement is the process of buying raw materials, and managing inventories to fit the need of the company. Procurement is about timing as well as purchasing, identifying the need and getting just enough at the right time to keep inventory costs low. In the procurement process it is important to find and contact suppliers. Communication plays a huge role in procurement. Suppliers will need to understand what the procurement manager wants, and when he needs it. Negotiating prices and contracts between supplier and purchaser are critical to procurement as well.
Operations management is overseeing the process of production and business operations in the production of goods and services. It manages the process of changing inputs in the form of labor, materials, and energy to outputs of goods and services.  With operations management, risks must be taken into account. In Operations Risk Management: Overview of Paul Kleindorfer's Contributions, Cohen and Kunreuther , highlight points that Kleindorfer makes about risks that messed be assessed in terms of operations management. Such as the unpredictability of demand and supply is a posed risk to operations management because they may produce too much or not enough goods and services to satisfy the demand (Cohen and Kunreuther). Corporations will suffer from loss of business from customer or loss of potential profit.

			<p>Logistics focuses on the transportation and storage of materials and goods. This includes handling, production, packaging, inventory, transportation, and warehousing. Logistics can be described as “having the right item in the right quantity at the right time at the right place for the right price in the right condition to the right customer” (Malik). There are many technologies that play a role in logistics. In this journal,“Factors affecting innovation in logistics technologies for logistics service providers in China”, the author, Chieh-Yu writes that:


“The transportation information system and geographical information system can help logistics managers planning, managing and controlling transportation issues. The global positioning 
system, and radio-frequency communication system can track and guide drivers during the transportation of products.”
Chieh-Yu provides solid examples of how technology can be used for logistics. Warehouses in a logistical sense are not only for storage, it should facilitate movement. Some technologies linked to logistical warehouses are “automated storage and retrieval systems (AS/RS), automatic sorting system, computer-aided picking system, and thermostat warehouse” (Chieh-Yu). The automated storage and retrieval is meant for high density, computer controlled systems used in distribution. It makes the use of warehouse very efficient. Technology plays a large role in supply chain management.

			<p>As Supply chains grow more and more complex, it is becoming globalized with the technologies that the world has. In the trade journal, “SUPPLY CHAIN GLOBALIZATION: The Era of Revitalized 
Command is Upon Us” by Sandor Boyson, supply chain is classified into three eras of global supply chain transformation. The first era, as described by Boyson was the Ford Motor Company, and its total vertical integration of production. Ford controlled all aspects of production from raw materials to manufacturing and assembly plants to railways, and airports for transport. Ford eliminated a lot of transaction costs that came with dealing with middle men. According to Boyson, the second era of supply chain has been “the era of virtualization”, meaning that businesses began to globalize, and outsourcing increased. This outsourcing, as well as informational technologies has “enabled the pooling of assets and capabilities into multi-enterprise virtual networks well beyond the formal/ traditional boundaries for any single enterprise” (Boyson 26). Corporations took advantages of cheaper labor overseas, and the technologies available enabled for efficient way to manage their supply chain. The current/ third era of supply chain illustrates the risk that comes with all the outsourcing.
“The multinational enterprise is becoming more risk-averse and less likely to over-extend itself through alliances, and is showing an emerging bias toward more direct absorption and control over assets in its network. This bias is clearly demonstrated in the recent intensification in outward U. S. cross- border merger and acquisition activity as a preferred method of investment” (Boyson 29).
Additionally the rising cost of transportation also leads to having more and more capacity on the home market. The last era shows how companies are moving back towards a tighter, closer network to avoid liabilities and risks, and to increase efficiency.
</p>
			<p>The eras that are used are excellent to give the casual reader a good overview of supply chain management history. From the limited knowledge of supply chain management, it does make sense. The three eras that Boyson described may be true to an extent, but it also is grossly generalized. It is important to categorize the history of supply chain to be able to see the differences in transitions. 
However, Boyson may have missed critical points in supply chain history that are not connected with the three eras. Although Boyson describes the current decline in outsourcing, it feels like it is still a viable business strategy, and very much utilized.

			<p>An interview with a supply chain professional Michael Wilson. Mr. Wilson is the father of one of my friends, and works in Buffalo, New York.  He says that having knowledge in computer skills is critical, expecially in Microsoft Excel and Access, and other software that deal with statistics. Besides having technical skills, people skills are also very important. The ability to effectively communicate with people to solve problems, and to effectively explain situations to people who do not understand the technical terms, are also very important skills to have. He notes that a lot of math is used while analyzing supply chains.</p>
